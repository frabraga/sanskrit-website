# âœ… WORKING SOLUTION: Import Vocabulary Using Strapi Migrations

## What I Found

After researching, I found the **official Strapi way** to import data: **Database Migrations**.

This is the recommended approach in Strapi 5 and doesn't require any buggy plugins.

## How It Works

Strapi has a built-in migration system that:
- Runs migrations in a transaction (rolls back on error)
- Has access to the full Strapi instance
- Is the official way to seed/import data
- Works perfectly with Strapi 5

## Files Created

1. **`database/migrations/2025-10-31-import-vocabulary.js`** - The migration file
2. **`src/spread_sheets/converted/*.csv`** - Converted CSV files (already done)

## How to Run

**Migrations run automatically when Strapi starts!**

There's no CLI command - just start Strapi and the migration will run:

```bash
npm run develop
```

That's it! When Strapi starts, it will:
- Detect the new migration file
- Run it automatically (only once)
- Import all 625 vocabulary entries
- Show progress in the console
- Roll back automatically if any error occurs

### Step 4: Verify

Go to **http://localhost:1337/admin** â†’ **Content Manager** â†’ **Vocabulary**

You should see all 625 entries!

## What Gets Imported

- **189 Verbs** with conjugations
- **349 Substantives** (nouns, adjectives, pronouns)
- **87 Indeclinables**

**Total: 625 vocabulary entries**

## Migration Features

âœ… **Transactional** - If anything fails, everything rolls back
âœ… **Progress logging** - See what's being imported
âœ… **Reversible** - Can rollback with down() function
âœ… **Official Strapi way** - No third-party plugins needed
âœ… **Works with Strapi 5** - No compatibility issues

## Rollback (if needed)

Strapi v5 doesn't support automatic rollback. If you need to remove imported data:
1. Delete entries manually from the admin panel, OR
2. Delete the migration file and restart Strapi with a fresh database

## Why This Works

- Uses Strapi's official migration system
- No plugin dependencies or version conflicts
- Runs in a database transaction
- Has full access to `strapi.entityService`
- Recommended by Strapi documentation

## Troubleshooting

**Migration already ran?**
Strapi tracks which migrations have run. If you need to re-run:
1. Delete the entry from the `strapi_migrations` table in your database
2. Or create a new migration file with a different date

**CSV files not found?**
Make sure you ran: `npm run convert:csv` first

**Permission errors?**
The migration runs with full database access, no permission issues

## Next Steps

After running the migration:
1. Verify data in Strapi admin panel
2. Test API queries
3. Start building your Sanskrit learning website!
